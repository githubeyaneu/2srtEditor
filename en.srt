1
00:00:41,420 --> 00:00:44,410
<i>Even before the sun had risen,
Antonia knew</i>

3
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:50,640
<i>She knew more than that,
she knew that this would be her last day.</i>

4
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:53,030
<i>Not that she felt unwell.</i>

5
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:55,880
<i>But unlike others</i>

6
00:00:56,020 --> 00:00:59,440
<i>Antonia knew when enough was enough.</i>

7
00:01:09,410 --> 00:01:13,560
<i>She would call her loved ones
to her bedside,</i>

8
00:01:13,910 --> 00:01:17,320
<i>to inform them of her imminent death,
close her eyes and die.</i>

9
00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:32,240
<i>Farmer Bas would make
her coffin himself.</i>

10
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:38,140
<i>Russian Olga would lay her out
with her customary discretion.</i>

11
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:41,740
<i>There would be nothing to be ashamed of.</i>

12
00:01:48,260 --> 00:01:51,600
<i>And her great-granddaughter
would not leave her death-bed,</i>

13
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:56,290
<i>would like to know about
the miracle of death</i>

14
00:01:56,690 --> 00:01:59,230
<i>and embrace her beloved
great-grandmother.</i>

15
00:02:03,010 --> 00:02:03,670
Yes.

16
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:07,300
It's time to die.

17
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:26,850
<i>She got out of bed to begin
the last day of her life.</i>

18
00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:36,580
A film by Marleen Gorris

19
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:06,950
Is this it?

20
00:05:08,150 --> 00:05:08,730
Yes.

21
00:05:10,050 --> 00:05:11,160
This is it.

22
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:37,840
Don't think much of it.

23
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:42,040
Nor did I when I left 20 years ago.

24
00:05:42,330 --> 00:05:44,140
It hasn't changed.

25
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:58,390
This village may not be much,
but at least it's quiet.

26
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:14,330
- Were you born here?
- Hmm.

27
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:21,480
<i>Soon after the war, Antonia returned
to bury her mother.</i>

28
00:06:21,630 --> 00:06:24,610
<i>But it turned out that she was
still very much alive.</i>

29
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:25,940
Bastards!

30
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:30,780
To hell with you!

31
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:35,550
Shitbag!
Shameless thieves!

32
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:41,390
Rotten swine!

33
00:06:47,930 --> 00:06:50,760
Just so as you know I know!

34
00:06:51,510 --> 00:06:54,210
Do you think I'm blind?

35
00:06:54,670 --> 00:06:59,710
That I don't see you're shafting them
in the alley behind the church?

36
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:05,530
- You godforsaken rat!
- Completely ga-ga.

37
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:08,220
But difficult. Always has been.

38
00:07:08,290 --> 00:07:11,890
You hypocritical filth!
Shitbag!

39
00:07:13,090 --> 00:07:15,779
But she's got a point.
Her father was a dirty old man.

40
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:20,220
Used to feel them up all day long.
He's been dead for 30 years.

41
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:24,980
Mother, I've come back.
How about that?

42
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:27,430
I came as quick as I could.

43
00:07:28,470 --> 00:07:30,970
This is my daughter Danielle.

44
00:07:33,490 --> 00:07:35,950
Get out of my sight, you demon!

45
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:38,480
You two-face, ruthless,

46
00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:40,490
drunken degenerate adulterer!

47
00:07:41,140 --> 00:07:44,130
You wicked, wicked man!

48
00:08:04,790 --> 00:08:05,830
Antonia?

49
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:09,520
Olga!

50
00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:12,940
Antonia?

51
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:17,610
Yes, Mother?

52
00:08:19,690 --> 00:08:20,480
Late

53
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:22,290
as usual.

54
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:24,130
Like your father.

55
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:25,610
Amen.

56
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:32,630
Rest in peace, Mom.

57
00:08:33,190 --> 00:08:35,600
Although it's very unlikely.

58
00:09:06,370 --> 00:09:09,790
This is Chiel, the blacksmith.
I used to go out with him.

59
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:10,660
Hi Chiel!

60
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:14,380
He's grown old...

61
00:09:20,010 --> 00:09:23,040
That's Crooked Finger's house.
He's an old friend.

62
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:26,510
How did he manage to survive the war?

63
00:09:39,130 --> 00:09:40,610
That's Mad Madonna.

64
00:09:41,090 --> 00:09:43,730
She bays at the full moon.

65
00:09:46,550 --> 00:09:48,460
She drives the Protestant wild.

66
00:09:48,830 --> 00:09:52,240
He'd prefer to be rather on top
of her. In more senses than one.

67
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:53,410
Come on.

68
00:09:59,070 --> 00:10:02,150
That's the CafÃ© of Olga the Russian.

69
00:10:03,530 --> 00:10:06,780
Her other professions:
midwife and undertaker.

70
00:10:07,770 --> 00:10:10,360
This wall serves as a toilet
on Saturday night.

71
00:10:11,050 --> 00:10:14,140
The smell the next day
bends nails.

72
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:15,690
Ah, the nuns!

73
00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:18,430
They're still not extinct.

74
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:18,640
It's all a load of rubbish really.
But that's the way things are in here.

75
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:59,270
So, the prodigal daughter's come back, eh?

76
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,100
Clever observation.

77
00:12:01,430 --> 00:12:04,340
Or are you as blind as dumb?

78
00:12:08,090 --> 00:12:15,410
Still as mean as a wasp and ugly, too.
But you've a well-shaped daughter.

79
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:17,810
Here, my two sons.

80
00:12:18,450 --> 00:12:22,680
Pure-blood stallions,
ready for breeding.

81
00:12:22,790 --> 00:12:25,900
Just right for this girl of yours, eh?

82
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:31,420
Olga, a gin please.

83
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:36,820
My daughter's up for offer too,
going for a song.

84
00:12:37,110 --> 00:12:41,999
She may not be the smartest,
but she's strong as a sow.

85
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,410
Her trousseau's been ready for years.

86
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:45,580
Deedee!

87
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:47,530
Deedee, come here! Come on!

88
00:12:47,770 --> 00:12:49,070
Inside!

89
00:12:50,390 --> 00:12:53,380
For Christ's sake, are you deaf?

90
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:57,010
Let them have a look at you.

91
00:12:59,150 --> 00:13:01,340
A solid wench, no?

92
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:04,710
Anyone wants to take her?

93
00:13:07,590 --> 00:13:08,720
Excuse me.

94
00:13:13,030 --> 00:13:14,590
Hey hey!

95
00:13:14,670 --> 00:13:16,650
Where do you think you're going?

96
00:13:16,790 --> 00:13:19,720
Drink up and shut your face!

97
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:44,700
<i>And so Antonia and her daughter, Danielle,
returned to the cradle of their ancestors.</i>

98
00:13:51,610 --> 00:13:54,280
<i>The two women settled into
a pink house</i>

99
00:13:55,420 --> 00:13:58,560
<i>and had so little to do with the village
that the villagers eventually accepted them:</i>

100
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:02,250
<i>just as they did a bad harvest,
a deformed child</i>

101
00:14:02,540 --> 00:14:07,580
<i>or the self evident, though unlikely,
omnipresence of God.</i>

102
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:35,320
<i>But one man was happy
with Antonia's return.</i>

103
00:14:36,630 --> 00:14:40,280
<i>Since the war ended,
Crooked Finger refused to leave his house.</i>

104
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:44,080
<i>So Antonia visited him instead,
and she took Danielle with her.</i>

105
00:15:52,510 --> 00:15:55,610
Remember walking in the woods together?

106
00:15:57,710 --> 00:15:59,810
Those woods hold lots of memories of us.

107
00:16:01,180 --> 00:16:02,940
- How's your wife doing?
- Fine. Fine.

108
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:04,470
Well...

109
00:16:41,196 --> 00:16:42,196
Get a move on!

110
00:16:49,850 --> 00:16:54,100
Come back, you ungrateful bastard!

111
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:57,410
You miserable swine! Come back!

112
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:04,240
<i>Although the mind of Loony Lips usually
worked more slowly than most</i>

113
00:17:04,310 --> 00:17:07,180
<i>it did not take him long to decide
to follow Antonia.</i>

114
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:15,390
<i>Farmer Bas was was a newcomer. He had only
lived in the village for 20 years.</i>

115
00:17:18,390 --> 00:17:21,170
<i>This complicated his dealings with
the other farmers. But not with Antonia.</i>

116
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:54,390
Not bad for a priest!

117
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:08,220
Hurry up, you idiot!

118
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:10,680
Hurry up, you goose!

119
00:18:12,010 --> 00:18:16,900
<i>Retarded Deedee lived with her mother,
father and two brothers on a farm.</i>

120
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:21,650
<i>The men's loud voices rode roughshod
over the women's silence.</i>

121
00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:42,580
Ma, where the hell are my Sunday shoes?

122
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:45,609
Have you seen my shoes?

123
00:18:45,610 --> 00:18:47,150
Huh? What?

124
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:17,040
Very generously proportioned was Cora.

125
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:20,970
Before Mass on Sunday she got sauced
on her bath-tub gin.

126
00:19:21,820 --> 00:19:24,270
Pushing her dung-cart and roaring
with laughter,

127
00:19:24,310 --> 00:19:27,120
she wove in and out of the churchgoers.

128
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:34,390
Bertie's buried there.
His father was in the cloth trade.

129
00:19:35,450 --> 00:19:38,120
Crooked Finger, Bertie and I
were best friends.

130
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:42,620
Bertie was in the resistance,
hid a Jewish family in the attic.

131
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:47,010
He was betrayed to the Germans
and they were all shot.

132
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:54,290
And guess who was too scared
to give him the Last Rites?

133
00:20:27,770 --> 00:20:28,860
Anyone at home?

134
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:34,010
Is anybody here?

135
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:42,250
Hello.

136
00:20:45,260 --> 00:20:46,830
I wanted to have a word.

137
00:20:48,550 --> 00:20:49,700
What about?

138
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:56,530
About you and me...

139
00:20:59,030 --> 00:21:00,090
About marriage.

140
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:03,570
I thought that ...

141
00:21:05,420 --> 00:21:08,510
you being a widow and my wife dead...

142
00:21:13,260 --> 00:21:15,610
You are a good-looking woman ...

143
00:21:21,090 --> 00:21:22,990
My sons need a mother.

144
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:25,710
But I don't need your sons.

145
00:21:26,930 --> 00:21:27,720
You don't?

146
00:21:29,710 --> 00:21:30,330
No.

147
00:21:36,650 --> 00:21:40,520
- Don't you want a husband, either?
- What for?

148
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:50,090
You can come round from time to time.
There's the odd job we can't do ourselves

149
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:55,060
and I'd be grateful if you'd lend a hand.

150
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:58,910
What's in it for me?

151
00:22:00,410 --> 00:22:03,710
A cup of coffee, fresh eggs, vegetables.

152
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:07,020
I've got all that myself.

153
00:22:14,050 --> 00:22:15,020
Okay.

154
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:18,360
I'll think about it.

155
00:22:47,650 --> 00:22:49,860
Boys, behave yourself!

156
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:18,970
Watch it!

157
00:23:29,710 --> 00:23:31,790
<i>Farmer Bas became a regular visitor.</i>

158
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:36,810
<i>Antonia gave him her affection,
but for the moment no more than that.</i>

159
00:23:57,300 --> 00:24:00,630
- I've come to get your saw.
- It's in the barn. I'll get it.

160
00:24:00,770 --> 00:24:02,580
Don't bother. I'll go.

161
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:45,380
Damn you!

162
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:16,030
Wait!

163
00:25:20,230 --> 00:25:22,050
Hush now. Hush.

164
00:25:23,530 --> 00:25:26,120
I'll bake you a lovely cake...

165
00:25:26,260 --> 00:25:27,120
Hold still!

166
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:30,650
and soon you'll have a nice bath.

167
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:34,930
Tomorrow we'll buy you new glasses.

168
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:19,330
<i>As usual, the villagers knew everything.</i>

169
00:26:20,030 --> 00:26:23,410
<i>But they were as silent as the grave
Pitte had nearly filled.</i>

170
00:26:29,820 --> 00:26:34,440
<i>When his wounds had healed, Pitte left.
No-one knew for where.</i>

171
00:26:44,780 --> 00:26:47,360
<i>"Birds of a feather flock together" Antonia said.</i>

172
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:50,010
<i>And Deedee and Loony Lips
found each other.</i>

173
00:28:30,820 --> 00:28:32,670
Has Crooked Finger seen this?

174
00:28:33,730 --> 00:28:35,950
He's only interested in books.

175
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:38,720
This isn't any good.

176
00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:42,660
I've got such a lot to learn.

177
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:56,130
<i>So Danielle went to art school.</i>

178
00:28:56,350 --> 00:28:57,760
<i>And she was happy.</i>

179
00:29:40,020 --> 00:29:44,330
<i>Days turned into weeks, then into years.</i>

180
00:29:44,580 --> 00:29:45,990
<i>Antonia planted,</i>

181
00:29:46,170 --> 00:29:47,660
<i>Danielle painted,</i>

182
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:50,770
<i>the fields turned green, then brown.</i>

183
00:29:55,830 --> 00:29:58,370
- Heave!
- Okay.

184
00:30:12,980 --> 00:30:13,670
Mom?

185
00:30:15,550 --> 00:30:17,910
- Mom?
- Huh?

186
00:30:18,510 --> 00:30:19,550
Mom, I want a baby.

187
00:30:25,890 --> 00:30:27,920
Whatever gave you that idea?

188
00:30:31,110 --> 00:30:32,080
A baby?

189
00:30:36,770 --> 00:30:39,620
How about a husband to go with it?

190
00:30:42,050 --> 00:30:44,080
I don't think so.

191
00:30:58,520 --> 00:31:01,810
Choosing a villager will mean trouble.

192
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:05,790
The farmers here only breed sons,

193
00:31:06,430 --> 00:31:09,520
and they can't see further
than the back end of a cow.

194
00:31:19,850 --> 00:31:21,400
Take deep breaths!

195
00:31:23,870 --> 00:31:25,330
Through your nose!

196
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:28,380
In a few months we'll go to the city.

197
00:31:29,710 --> 00:31:32,170
And there we'll find you a father.

198
00:32:24,370 --> 00:32:25,470
What's this?

199
00:32:26,890 --> 00:32:29,480
Seems like a house for fallen women.

200
00:32:30,930 --> 00:32:33,190
I doubt if these'll ever get up again.

201
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:34,630
Let's go!

202
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:36,390
Come in!

203
00:32:40,310 --> 00:32:41,430
Sit down.

204
00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:53,000
Nothing better

205
00:32:53,570 --> 00:32:54,900
than being pregnant.

206
00:32:55,340 --> 00:32:58,100
This is my second time. And believe me,

207
00:32:58,590 --> 00:33:01,580
it's not the copulation or

208
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:05,339
the kids that come out of it

209
00:33:05,340 --> 00:33:07,840
but the carrying and giving birth
that makes it worthwhile.

210
00:33:07,990 --> 00:33:10,040
It's the most beautiful thing on earth!

211
00:33:30,390 --> 00:33:32,140
We urgently need the services

212
00:33:35,390 --> 00:33:39,240
- of a man.
- A man! Who doesn't?

213
00:33:43,610 --> 00:33:45,510
Just to get me pregnant.

214
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:51,590
I don't want him into the bargain.
All I want is a child.

215
00:33:52,210 --> 00:33:53,680
He doesn't have to know about it.

216
00:33:54,490 --> 00:33:57,950
What the eye doesn't see,
the heart doesn't grieve about.

217
00:34:03,210 --> 00:34:05,140
In that case, I'm with you.

218
00:34:07,390 --> 00:34:08,880
Here we go.

219
00:34:15,580 --> 00:34:16,720
Nice bike.

220
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:19,720
An Adonis!

221
00:34:20,370 --> 00:34:22,230
What does he do for a living?

222
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:25,480
Good breeding?

223
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:28,220
He's family!

224
00:36:39,050 --> 00:36:40,990
Once more. Come on!

225
00:37:39,070 --> 00:37:40,930
Did you see stars?

226
00:37:41,140 --> 00:37:44,170
Did I have to?

227
00:37:44,590 --> 00:37:46,250
- It helps...
- It's not essential.

228
00:37:47,330 --> 00:37:50,320
- Wow I'm hungry.
- That's a good sign. -Yeah.

229
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:52,700
We're a fertile family.

230
00:37:53,100 --> 00:37:56,580
Letto, it was a real pleasure. You know
where to find me if you need me.

231
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:59,240
- Come on.
- Go and have something good.

232
00:37:59,780 --> 00:38:05,990
- I see you're really lucky.
- Apparently. - Yes!

233
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:08,710
He was considerate.

234
00:38:10,210 --> 00:38:14,180
...corruption that has infects us all.

235
00:38:14,940 --> 00:38:18,189
Of such, Peter, the rock upon whom
the Church is built, warns:

236
00:38:18,190 --> 00:38:23,690
"Them that walk after the flesh in the lust
of uncleanness and despise government."

237
00:38:24,070 --> 00:38:28,690
"Presumptuous are they and not afraid
to speak evil of dignities".

238
00:38:29,150 --> 00:38:34,730
The kingdom of the Jews fell through
Jezebel and her cursed daughter.

239
00:38:39,870 --> 00:38:44,200
More the shame that these are women!

240
00:38:44,490 --> 00:38:47,190
They should set an example

241
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:50,370
by humility and obedience,

242
00:38:51,130 --> 00:38:55,260
and teach their daughters chastity.

243
00:38:56,210 --> 00:38:58,380
Let them repent

244
00:38:58,580 --> 00:39:04,680
lest they be cast into hellfire
at the day of judgment!

245
00:39:38,120 --> 00:39:41,909
<i>Farmer Bas realized there was
only one solution:</i>

246
00:39:41,910 --> 00:39:43,040
<i>Blackmail.</i>

247
00:40:24,470 --> 00:40:26,240
Jesus, Mary, Joseph!

248
00:40:29,220 --> 00:40:31,630
... and Our Lord said unto them:

249
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:35,680
"He that is without sin among you
let him cast a stone at her."

250
00:40:36,830 --> 00:40:41,760
And just as her accusers left,
convicted by their own consciences,

251
00:40:41,850 --> 00:40:46,920
so we must think of our own transgressions
before condemning others.

252
00:40:47,620 --> 00:40:52,570
Let us also remember that salvation
came into the world through a woman.

253
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:57,730
No one seeks her protection or help
in vain.

254
00:41:00,140 --> 00:41:04,530
Nor should we forget the lesson
read on the feast day of a holy woman:

255
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:08,700
"She openeth her mouth with wisdom;"

256
00:41:09,230 --> 00:41:12,880
"in her tongue is the law of kindness."

257
00:41:13,710 --> 00:41:16,700
"She looketh well to the ways
of her household,"

258
00:41:17,190 --> 00:41:20,750
"and eateth not the bread of idleness."

259
00:41:37,170 --> 00:41:40,860
<i>Danielle gave birth to a daughter,
and called her ThÃ©rÃ¨se.</i>

260
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:16,920
<i>And so the years passed.</i>

261
00:42:17,090 --> 00:42:18,710
<i>Antonia and Danielle</i>

262
00:42:18,790 --> 00:42:22,320
<i>took ThÃ©rÃ¨se on their visits
to Crooked Finger.</i>

263
00:42:24,120 --> 00:42:29,520
<i>It seemed ThÃ©rÃ¨se understood Crooked
Finger better than Danielle ever did.</i>

264
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:32,520
Imagine moving to another time scale,

265
00:42:32,540 --> 00:42:38,260
so that a lifespan of 80 years
would be over in 29 days,

266
00:42:38,620 --> 00:42:41,740
or last 80,000 years.

267
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:44,720
- Time ...
- But what about time?

268
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:46,270
Did we invent time?

269
00:42:47,540 --> 00:42:49,360
Yes, we made it up.

270
00:42:51,640 --> 00:42:53,840
Perhaps ants live in their time...

271
00:42:54,380 --> 00:42:56,940
- And crickets...
- A bees...

272
00:42:57,520 --> 00:43:00,510
- And butterflies...
- And the trees...

273
00:43:00,840 --> 00:43:03,800
- And stars...
- And the moon!

274
00:43:08,570 --> 00:43:10,080
Finger, you smell!

275
00:43:10,120 --> 00:43:10,870
That, my dear,

276
00:43:11,380 --> 00:43:14,050
...is the smell of time past.

277
00:43:15,640 --> 00:43:19,770
<i>And Finger and ThÃ©rÃ¨se enfolded
each other in their hearts.</i>

278
00:43:32,340 --> 00:43:36,370
<i>Thwarted in love by the dogmas
of their different faiths,</i>

279
00:43:36,510 --> 00:43:42,730
<i>the Protestant remained as far
from his Madonna as the moon she howled at.</i>

280
00:43:51,060 --> 00:43:52,780
<i>The Priest left the church because,</i>

281
00:43:52,870 --> 00:43:56,840
<i>as he put it, he could not reconcile
his enjoyment of life</i>

282
00:43:56,850 --> 00:43:59,430
<i>with the Church's enjoyment of death.</i>

283
00:44:17,130 --> 00:44:20,230
I'm free!
I'm free!

284
00:44:41,360 --> 00:44:42,590
Deedee!

285
00:45:37,740 --> 00:45:40,880
Some years ago you asked for my hand.

286
00:45:42,020 --> 00:45:43,830
You still can't have my hand.

287
00:45:44,250 --> 00:45:45,510
But you can have the rest.

288
00:45:53,250 --> 00:45:56,110
After all these chaste years
I've got the urge again.

289
00:45:56,930 --> 00:45:58,980
How about once a week?

290
00:46:01,620 --> 00:46:03,700
Perhaps more often ...?

291
00:46:04,110 --> 00:46:05,690
Once in a while...?

292
00:46:06,500 --> 00:46:08,370
Should the need arise...

293
00:46:10,270 --> 00:46:14,620
If the need arises, we must
give that serious consideration.

294
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:23,950
And not in my house or yours. That's much
too hectic for people of our age.

295
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:25,330
<i>The seasons repeated themselves.
Time gave birth again and again.</i>

296
00:47:25,470 --> 00:47:28,570
<i>and with complete contentment
produced nothing except itself.</i>

297
00:47:50,520 --> 00:47:53,610
Try this. It's very juicy.

298
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:01,960
Letta!

299
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:04,320
Pregnant again?

300
00:48:04,560 --> 00:48:06,360
What number's this one?

301
00:48:07,310 --> 00:48:09,260
I have nowhere to go.

302
00:48:11,170 --> 00:48:15,340
Children of the future, remember that
I did my best... Come on in.

303
00:48:28,010 --> 00:48:31,100
This is Simon, my eldest.
Take off your cap!

304
00:48:32,180 --> 00:48:34,230
And this is Arletta.

305
00:48:36,810 --> 00:48:38,400
Is that...?

306
00:48:39,480 --> 00:48:41,430
Yes, that's my daughter ThÃ©rÃ¨se.

307
00:48:41,570 --> 00:48:43,620
Poppet...

308
00:48:45,740 --> 00:48:47,330
Haven't I grown?

309
00:48:47,830 --> 00:48:49,880
Spittin' image of her dad!

310
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:53,950
How's my father?

311
00:48:54,090 --> 00:48:59,170
Fine! He's married to a horribly ugly
girl with a heart of gold,

312
00:48:59,310 --> 00:49:04,950
buckets of common sense,
and a brewery. He's very happy.

313
00:49:09,480 --> 00:49:12,750
- Who's that?
- The Priest.

314
00:49:17,300 --> 00:49:19,090
He has left the church.

315
00:49:29,500 --> 00:49:31,440
God bless you, ma'am!

316
00:49:31,580 --> 00:49:33,630
I should hope so too.

317
00:49:47,100 --> 00:49:50,220
<i>The Priest lovingly knocked her up
every year,</i>

318
00:49:50,360 --> 00:49:53,460
<i>and they lived happily ever after.</i>

319
00:50:12,690 --> 00:50:16,400
- Since when can you do additions?
- Since I was three.

320
00:50:17,120 --> 00:50:21,080
- Who taught you?
- I taught myself.

321
00:50:21,980 --> 00:50:24,500
Crooked Finger helped a bit.

322
00:50:25,260 --> 00:50:28,750
How much is 147 times 48?

323
00:50:28,900 --> 00:50:31,990
7056, of course.

324
00:50:38,290 --> 00:50:40,340
Square root is 84.

325
00:50:42,460 --> 00:50:47,630
The square is 49,787,136.

326
00:50:52,530 --> 00:50:57,300
I regret to have to tell you
your daughter isn't normal.

327
00:50:59,150 --> 00:51:03,670
- I'm a child prodigy.
- I fear you are.

328
00:51:03,830 --> 00:51:08,400
This is Lara Anderson,
ThÃ©rÃ¨se's teacher.

329
00:51:08,550 --> 00:51:11,070
The First Grade's teacher, I mean.

330
00:51:11,120 --> 00:51:12,960
She's responsible for 30 children...

331
00:51:13,100 --> 00:51:15,480
- It's a challenging task.
- Quite.

332
00:51:16,380 --> 00:51:20,120
ThÃ©rÃ¨se is far in advance of
the others.

333
00:51:20,480 --> 00:51:22,710
It creates problems,
she needs a lot of attention.

334
00:51:22,950 --> 00:51:27,280
I suggest that you and I,
and possibly others

335
00:51:27,990 --> 00:51:36,050
take responsibility and give ThÃ©rÃ¨se
extra tutoring besides her normal lessons,

336
00:51:37,310 --> 00:51:39,040
which I shall adapt accordingly.
What subjects are you good in?

337
00:51:40,890 --> 00:51:43,980
All the colors of the spectrum.
She knows everything about painting.

338
00:51:45,540 --> 00:51:47,340
She's not a bad carpenter, either.

339
00:51:48,110 --> 00:51:52,020
Crooked Finger will help.
He knows more than is good for him.

340
00:51:52,110 --> 00:51:54,949
Philosophy, poetry, comparative religion ...

341
00:51:54,950 --> 00:51:57,550
Logic. The exact sciences.

342
00:51:58,500 --> 00:52:02,660
I suggest two or three hours
extra per day.

343
00:52:03,270 --> 00:52:04,850
Is that suitable?

344
00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:14,240
Is that suitable?

345
00:52:16,190 --> 00:52:17,630
To begin with.

346
00:52:24,710 --> 00:52:26,760
What time is she coming?

347
00:52:28,380 --> 00:52:30,540
Didn't she say after dinner?

348
00:52:30,570 --> 00:52:32,430
That's now!

349
00:52:32,660 --> 00:52:38,490
Perhaps she eats late.
Perhaps she doesn't want to come.

350
00:52:45,620 --> 00:52:47,510
Was it today she said she'd come?

351
00:52:47,600 --> 00:52:48,600
Yeah.

352
00:52:50,880 --> 00:52:52,780
Does she drink coffee or tea?

353
00:52:53,860 --> 00:52:57,410
How should I know?
Stand still or sit down!

354
00:53:13,110 --> 00:53:14,580
Hello.

355
00:53:15,680 --> 00:53:17,030
Hello, ThÃ©rÃ¨se.

356
00:53:18,420 --> 00:53:20,070
- Hello.
- Hello.

357
00:53:25,160 --> 00:53:28,820
Reverend Mother says
that God created everything.

358
00:53:29,110 --> 00:53:32,320
But she won't ask herself
who created God.

359
00:53:33,590 --> 00:53:38,020
The tragedy of those who believe in a God
is that their faith rules their intellect.

360
00:53:38,920 --> 00:53:43,580
In my experience, religions
often cause death and destruction.

361
00:53:45,240 --> 00:53:46,960
But we were discussing Plato.

362
00:53:51,610 --> 00:53:54,160
Isn't it terrible...that nothing exists?

363
00:53:54,780 --> 00:53:56,610
That's why there's so much.

364
00:54:03,690 --> 00:54:08,240
- Have you ever eaten artichokes?
Shall I tell you how? - Yes.

365
00:54:08,450 --> 00:54:13,580
An Artichoke is is thick and round
and green.

366
00:54:17,550 --> 00:54:22,900
The leaves are fleshy and soft. First,
boil the artichoke in salted water.

367
00:54:22,901 --> 00:54:26,357
Then, peel off the leaves, one by one,
dip them in a vinaigrette sauce,

368
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:32,474
then scrape off the tender flesh
with your teeth until you reach the heart.

369
00:54:32,720 --> 00:54:33,910
The heart?

370
00:54:35,010 --> 00:54:36,000
Yes, the heart.

371
00:54:40,140 --> 00:54:43,520
- And what do I do with the heart?
- You savour it,

372
00:54:44,310 --> 00:54:48,350
bit by bit, with your eyes closed.
It's a delicacy.

373
00:54:48,650 --> 00:54:52,520
- The whole thing is a delicacy.
- Yes, all of it is a delicacy.

374
00:54:52,660 --> 00:54:55,220
Am I going to have my lessons or not?

375
00:55:18,150 --> 00:55:21,830
<i>And then love burst out everywhere.</i>

376
00:57:00,360 --> 00:57:02,450
I can't sleep!

377
00:57:28,870 --> 00:57:32,760
<i>That year Mad Madonna died of
a broken heart.</i>

378
00:57:51,300 --> 00:57:53,670
<i>The Protestant soon followed her.</i>

379
00:57:54,200 --> 00:57:56,400
<i>"Force of habit," said the villagers.</i>

380
00:58:06,990 --> 00:58:10,600
<i>"They did not share a table,
they did not share a bed."</i>

381
00:58:10,720 --> 00:58:12,740
<i>"Now they simply share a grave."</i>

382
00:58:30,520 --> 00:58:34,640
<i>Farmer Dan fell from the harvester
and broke his neck.</i>

383
00:58:42,190 --> 00:58:49,670
<i>After 15 years of absence,
Pitte returned to claim his inheritance.</i>

384
00:58:52,110 --> 00:58:55,380
Money, money, money.

385
00:59:44,270 --> 00:59:47,030
Look who's here!

386
00:59:52,660 --> 00:59:53,880
Ladies...

387
00:59:59,810 --> 01:00:03,270
- Who's that?
- The devil. Open the door.

388
01:00:12,700 --> 01:00:16,660
<i>ThÃ©rÃ¨se grew up with Simon,
Letta's eldest son.</i>

389
01:00:16,800 --> 01:00:20,300
<i>He loved ThÃ©rÃ¨se, and would continue
to do so all his life.</i>

390
01:00:22,370 --> 01:00:25,720
- Simon's in love!
- Simon's in love!

391
01:00:29,320 --> 01:00:31,260
<i>ThÃ©rÃ¨se soon discovered</i>

392
01:00:31,410 --> 01:00:34,390
<i>that thought needed more than just brains.</i>

393
01:00:34,540 --> 01:00:40,310
<i>Her love of music and mathematics
provided for the needs of heart and head.</i>

394
01:00:40,380 --> 01:00:44,830
<i>She limited herself to those subjects,
and became an authority in both.</i>

395
01:00:45,890 --> 01:00:48,350
Your essay has undeniable merits,

396
01:00:50,190 --> 01:00:56,150
but it exceeds your assignment's limits.

397
01:00:56,760 --> 01:01:01,210
I specifically stipulated two pages.

398
01:01:01,300 --> 01:01:05,380
You wrote five. So it's insufficient.

399
01:01:06,020 --> 01:01:11,210
In our discipline it is essential,
an absolute necessity...

400
01:01:11,630 --> 01:01:18,010
Let me put it this way:
"Mastery reveals itself in limitation."

401
01:01:18,290 --> 01:01:22,360
Since you can't distinguish
quality from quantity,

402
01:01:22,460 --> 01:01:26,590
I can only come to the conclusion
that you are incompetent.

403
01:01:33,630 --> 01:01:34,950
Up the truth!

404
01:01:36,380 --> 01:01:38,080
Up the revolution!

405
01:01:47,060 --> 01:01:48,510
Up your!

406
01:02:26,810 --> 01:02:30,720
<i>In those enlightened times
ThÃ©rÃ¨se was raped.</i>

407
01:02:32,580 --> 01:02:34,020
By Pitte.

408
01:02:34,800 --> 01:02:36,940
Drinks are on me!

409
01:02:38,060 --> 01:02:39,930
Beer for everyone.

410
01:02:45,590 --> 01:02:48,070
You got something to celebrate, then?

411
01:02:49,060 --> 01:02:52,160
Are you all right now?

412
01:02:57,050 --> 01:02:58,050
Try and sleep.

413
01:03:42,270 --> 01:03:43,730
He isn't here.

414
01:04:21,850 --> 01:04:22,860
Stand up!

415
01:04:31,170 --> 01:04:32,180
Outside.

416
01:04:33,260 --> 01:04:34,540
And quickly.

417
01:04:57,510 --> 01:04:58,570
Stop!

418
01:05:01,430 --> 01:05:03,480
- Be reasonable...
- Shut your mouth!

419
01:05:05,050 --> 01:05:08,230
If you move, I'll shoot.

420
01:05:09,780 --> 01:05:12,760
If I had it in me to kill someone,
I would kill you.

421
01:05:13,310 --> 01:05:15,790
Instead, I'll curse you.

422
01:05:16,130 --> 01:05:19,250
And my curse will haunt you forever.

423
01:05:19,330 --> 01:05:20,260
Silence!

424
01:05:22,190 --> 01:05:24,230
If you ever return,

425
01:05:24,350 --> 01:05:28,530
my curse will savage you to death.

426
01:05:28,820 --> 01:05:32,020
If you ever return,
my hate will destroy you.

427
01:05:32,050 --> 01:05:36,920
Your bones will break,
your tongue will erupt with pus.

428
01:05:37,600 --> 01:05:42,149
If you ever return,
the water you drink will poison you,

429
01:05:42,150 --> 01:05:45,030
the food you eat will fester inside you,

430
01:05:45,040 --> 01:05:48,170
the air you breathe will rot your lungs.

431
01:05:48,620 --> 01:05:54,340
You will beg in vain to be released
from the torment that is your punishment

432
01:05:54,480 --> 01:05:56,880
for raping a child.

433
01:07:54,350 --> 01:07:55,520
Help me...

434
01:08:49,700 --> 01:08:55,200
<i>Janne was now lord and master.
And he liked his new role.</i>

435
01:08:57,450 --> 01:09:02,490
<i>The village buzzed with rumours,
but no one pointed an accusing finger.</i>

436
01:09:02,580 --> 01:09:07,010
<i>They were glad to be rid
of the dearly departed.</i>

437
01:09:44,320 --> 01:09:46,630
They're going to perform
my composition.

438
01:09:48,660 --> 01:09:50,080
Are you glad?

439
01:09:52,840 --> 01:09:54,170
I suppose so.

440
01:10:01,190 --> 01:10:03,480
Come on, shh.

441
01:10:07,440 --> 01:10:09,340
The world is a hell,

442
01:10:09,870 --> 01:10:14,540
inhabited by tormented souls and demons.

443
01:10:17,420 --> 01:10:18,670
Schopenhauer?

444
01:10:29,960 --> 01:10:34,660
<i>The proverb is wrong.
Time does not heal all wounds.</i>

445
01:10:34,680 --> 01:10:39,030
<i>It merely softens the pain,
and blurs the memories.</i>

446
01:10:43,030 --> 01:10:46,910
<i>The years passed.
ThÃ©rÃ¨se reached the age of 20.</i>

447
01:10:51,760 --> 01:10:56,870
We can assume that the singular chain
complex of the empty set equals zero.

448
01:10:57,040 --> 01:11:01,680
With theorem 5.8 this implies
that n-th homology group

449
01:11:01,930 --> 01:11:05,960
is the same as the
n-th relative homology group,

450
01:11:06,110 --> 01:11:08,780
if we take subspace
as the empty set.

451
01:11:10,280 --> 01:11:15,030
Now we can construct a functor from the
category...from the category of Top 2

452
01:11:15,130 --> 01:11:18,360
to the category of chain complexes.

453
01:11:19,750 --> 01:11:23,610
Define the functor S* as follows:

454
01:11:24,220 --> 01:11:29,880
S* sends ordered X.A
to the singular chain complex

455
01:11:29,970 --> 01:11:35,820
of the space X divided by
the complex of A.

456
01:11:50,100 --> 01:11:54,860
<i>She experimented with a few intellectuals,
but found them wanting.</i>

457
01:11:56,300 --> 01:12:05,030
Our neo-capitalistic society
reduces socialist alternatives

458
01:12:05,120 --> 01:12:08,590
to non-material adjustments
of formal behaviour.

459
01:12:08,680 --> 01:12:11,769
Humanity is an intersection
of relationships,

460
01:12:11,770 --> 01:12:17,320
which is the initial premise.
Relationships are disturbed,

461
01:12:17,410 --> 01:12:22,490
because society itself makes
healthy relationships impossible.

462
01:12:22,600 --> 01:12:27,370
In a male female dialogue,
property becomes a basic drive

463
01:12:27,430 --> 01:12:33,200
whose survival value only exists
because society guarantees it.

464
01:12:33,260 --> 01:12:37,050
<i>Their self-indulgent blather
insulted ThÃ©rÃ¨se's intelligence.</i>

465
01:12:37,560 --> 01:12:42,470
<i>Nor was she compensated physically.</i>

466
01:12:42,900 --> 01:12:45,120
What did I do? What did I do?

467
01:12:46,990 --> 01:12:53,200
<i>And ThÃ©rÃ¨se, who was used to best,
refused to put up with this.</i>

468
01:13:02,160 --> 01:13:06,890
<i>Simon, Letta's eldest son,
was not ThÃ©rÃ¨se's intellectual equal.</i>

469
01:13:06,950 --> 01:13:12,670
<i>But their childhood friendship ripened
into love and this contented her.</i>

470
01:13:12,750 --> 01:13:15,250
Will you marry me?

471
01:13:16,040 --> 01:13:20,340
I love you Simon, but marriage
would be a mistake.

472
01:13:22,270 --> 01:13:25,360
I can't give you enough attention.

473
01:13:25,930 --> 01:13:28,880
But we make such good love.

474
01:13:29,660 --> 01:13:31,660
That's why.

475
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:13,250
I think I'm pregnant.

476
01:14:15,680 --> 01:14:17,270
Pregnant?

477
01:14:25,070 --> 01:14:25,980
Yeah.

478
01:14:34,900 --> 01:14:36,220
Do you want it?

479
01:14:36,770 --> 01:14:40,010
- Of course she wants it!
- Of course she doesn't.

480
01:14:40,090 --> 01:14:41,660
- Sure she does.
- She doesn't.

481
01:14:41,750 --> 01:14:43,720
- Of course she wants it.
- No, certainly not.

482
01:14:43,760 --> 01:14:45,880
- She'll have it.
- She won't.

483
01:14:45,920 --> 01:14:48,210
- Yes, she will.
- No, of course not.

484
01:14:54,780 --> 01:14:57,850
- Yes! - No!
- Yes! - No! - Yes!

485
01:15:00,030 --> 01:15:00,780
Well?

486
01:15:02,790 --> 01:15:05,500
I'll have to give this serious thought.

487
01:15:08,620 --> 01:15:10,580
Haven't you any pity for this child?

488
01:15:13,220 --> 01:15:16,310
Wouldn't you rather save it
from the misery of life?

489
01:15:17,030 --> 01:15:21,420
Or at least not to burden yourself with
the cold-blooded crime of giving it life?

490
01:15:21,630 --> 01:15:25,200
This is not time for Schopenhauer.
This is important.

491
01:15:25,400 --> 01:15:29,320
I don't know how you can do it,
bring another being into this world...

492
01:15:29,700 --> 01:15:32,370
this rotten world...

493
01:16:01,400 --> 01:16:05,270
<i>ThÃ©rÃ¨se and Simon had a daughter,
and called her Sarah.</i>

494
01:16:20,970 --> 01:16:23,020
What a beautiful girl.

495
01:16:25,140 --> 01:16:28,240
With red hair, like her father.

496
01:16:49,860 --> 01:16:53,860
<i>ThÃ©rÃ¨se's reception of her baby
left a little bit to be desired.</i>

497
01:17:01,590 --> 01:17:04,680
<i>But Simon explained why.</i>

498
01:17:05,760 --> 01:17:10,300
I regret to have to tell you, Sarah,
but your mother isn't normal.

499
01:17:18,060 --> 01:17:20,010
<i>Time flowed.</i>

500
01:17:20,240 --> 01:17:26,170
<i>Season followed season, tumbling over
one another as if in their dance</i>

501
01:17:26,630 --> 01:17:32,390
<i>they wanted to end the exhausting
round of birth and death.</i>

502
01:17:52,710 --> 01:17:54,560
Finger, this is for you.

503
01:17:54,610 --> 01:17:57,880
You thought we'd forgotten,
didn't you?

504
01:17:59,060 --> 01:18:02,000
Now you can start on Sarah.

505
01:18:04,120 --> 01:18:05,440
We can...

506
01:18:06,050 --> 01:18:07,930
read Nietzsche together.

507
01:18:08,740 --> 01:18:11,580
Finger, why do you never go out?

508
01:18:15,600 --> 01:18:18,690
(quotes in German)
"The best thing of all is not to be born,"

509
01:18:19,720 --> 01:18:22,320
<i>"...not to be, to be nothing."</i>

510
01:18:23,760 --> 01:18:26,650
- "The next best thing is..."
- Stop it, Finger!

511
01:18:28,400 --> 01:18:30,030
"...is to die."

512
01:18:55,690 --> 01:18:57,520
Look at me!

513
01:18:57,900 --> 01:19:01,400
- Very nice, darling.
- Look! - Yeah.

514
01:19:05,360 --> 01:19:09,170
Sarah! What happened?
Did you fall? Let me have a look.

515
01:19:11,270 --> 01:19:13,130
Let's go inside for a while.

516
01:19:14,570 --> 01:19:18,330
- What happened?
- Fell from a swing.

517
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:17,740
Great-grandmother!
Great-grandmother!

518
01:20:22,750 --> 01:20:25,850
Look! Read what I've written!

519
01:20:32,140 --> 01:20:34,090
But Deedee isn't dead yet.

520
01:20:34,230 --> 01:20:37,320
That's why. So she can read it now.

521
01:20:41,530 --> 01:20:44,630
Deedee! Want to read this?

522
01:20:45,700 --> 01:20:47,760
It's for you.

523
01:20:56,830 --> 01:20:59,120
"Poem for Deedee, dead and gone."

524
01:20:59,270 --> 01:21:02,260
"Deedee is a grey dove, old and lovely."

525
01:21:02,400 --> 01:21:04,340
"I'm glad she's not dead."

526
01:21:04,480 --> 01:21:07,400
"Because when she dies
I know I'll miss her a lot."

527
01:21:07,550 --> 01:21:13,660
"Because after Great-grandma,
Mom, Lara,"

528
01:21:13,810 --> 01:21:17,840
"and my Grandma, Deedee is the dearest
woman in the whole village,"

529
01:21:17,980 --> 01:21:21,070
"in the whole province,
in the whole country,"

530
01:21:23,250 --> 01:21:27,330
"That's what Deedee is
now she's not yet dead."

531
01:21:30,500 --> 01:21:32,550
Lovely! Lovely!

532
01:21:37,240 --> 01:21:39,850
I'm going to write some more,
great-grandma.

533
01:21:49,740 --> 01:21:54,490
<i>Almost as if Sarah's poem
had given Death the idea,</i>

534
01:21:54,590 --> 01:21:58,130
<i>suddenly a lot of villagers died.</i>

535
01:22:13,210 --> 01:22:16,590
<i>Letta had given birth to 12 children
with the greatest of ease.</i>

536
01:22:16,650 --> 01:22:19,210
<i>The thirteenth was fatal.</i>

537
01:22:23,540 --> 01:22:24,590
Damn!

538
01:22:25,490 --> 01:22:27,970
I did so want to continue.

539
01:22:36,800 --> 01:22:39,680
<i>The Priest left for the city
with his 12 disciples,</i>

540
01:22:39,740 --> 01:22:42,270
<i>and became a social worker.</i>

541
01:22:50,360 --> 01:22:55,530
<i>Janne received a well-aimed kick
from a much maltreated cow.</i>

542
01:23:07,840 --> 01:23:11,490
<i>Loony Lips died in a tractor accident.</i>

543
01:23:11,640 --> 01:23:13,690
<i>And Deedee was inconsolable.</i>

544
01:23:31,360 --> 01:23:34,560
<i>And still the tragedies were not over.</i>

545
01:24:25,650 --> 01:24:27,700
<i>"My dearest ThÃ©rÃ¨se,"</i>

546
01:24:33,990 --> 01:24:38,720
<i>"It is absurd to believe that
the constant pain afflicting us"</i>

547
01:24:39,210 --> 01:24:41,260
<i>"is there purely by chance."</i>

548
01:24:43,720 --> 01:24:45,140
<i>"On the contrary."</i>

549
01:24:45,780 --> 01:24:48,570
<i>"Misery is the norm,
not the exception."</i>

550
01:24:50,690 --> 01:24:53,590
<i>"Who can I blame for our existence?"</i>

551
01:24:54,130 --> 01:24:57,110
<i>"Not the accident of the sun
which gives us life."</i>

552
01:25:00,540 --> 01:25:06,680
<i>"I accuse myself, since I don't believe
in God or a hereafter."</i>

553
01:25:08,420 --> 01:25:12,460
<i>"If I did, I could delude myself
that life promises"</i>

554
01:25:12,920 --> 01:25:17,710
<i>"a heavenly dessert after
an indigestible main course."</i>

555
01:25:27,980 --> 01:25:30,120
<i>"I have never been able to accept"</i>

556
01:25:30,260 --> 01:25:34,390
<i>"the common misconception that
everything one day will be better."</i>

557
01:25:40,820 --> 01:25:42,750
<i>"Nothing will be better."</i>

558
01:25:43,580 --> 01:25:49,000
<i>"At best or at worst,
it will only be different."</i>

559
01:26:04,280 --> 01:26:06,120
<i>"I no longer want to think..."</i>

560
01:26:07,200 --> 01:26:10,150
<i>"Above all else, no longer think..."</i>

561
01:27:35,100 --> 01:27:36,340
Mom...

562
01:27:41,520 --> 01:27:42,450
Hush, now...

563
01:28:07,030 --> 01:28:10,660
<i>ThÃ©rÃ¨se became more and more withdrawn.</i>

564
01:28:11,790 --> 01:28:15,980
<i>But Danielle reacted to her daughter's
grief with rage.</i>

565
01:28:38,050 --> 01:28:41,350
Where is Crooked Finger?
Where's everybody?

566
01:28:41,910 --> 01:28:44,470
Crooked Finger's body is burned

567
01:28:45,270 --> 01:28:48,150
and his ashes scattered on the earth.

568
01:28:48,940 --> 01:28:50,110
But...

569
01:28:51,190 --> 01:28:52,820
Nothing dies forever.

570
01:28:54,430 --> 01:28:56,290
Something always remains.

571
01:28:57,290 --> 01:28:59,920
from which something new grows.

572
01:29:00,820 --> 01:29:04,940
So life begins, without knowing
where it came from

573
01:29:05,850 --> 01:29:07,270
or why it exists.

574
01:29:07,500 --> 01:29:08,650
But why?

575
01:29:09,790 --> 01:29:11,890
Because life wants to live.

576
01:29:13,340 --> 01:29:15,280
Isn't there a heaven either?

577
01:29:15,740 --> 01:29:18,520
This is the only dance we dance.

578
01:29:23,770 --> 01:29:26,230
Which of us is going to die first?

579
01:29:28,080 --> 01:29:30,980
If I have my way,

580
01:29:31,100 --> 01:29:32,720
I'll die first.

581
01:29:33,090 --> 01:29:35,600
But I'm not intending to right now.

582
01:29:38,650 --> 01:29:41,300
I'll tell you when the time comes.

583
01:29:41,660 --> 01:29:45,570
Don't worry, I've still got
years left in me.

584
01:29:47,000 --> 01:29:48,710
Thank goodness!

585
01:29:52,920 --> 01:29:53,920
Deedee.

586
01:29:56,340 --> 01:30:00,090
There's nothing for it.
Life's got to be lived.

587
01:30:14,520 --> 01:30:16,770
<i>Time conquered Time.</i>

588
01:30:16,910 --> 01:30:20,940
<i>Although not as many children
were born as in Letta's day,</i>

589
01:30:21,090 --> 01:30:24,840
<i>there were enough
to keep the world turning.</i>

590
01:30:26,300 --> 01:30:30,730
<i>Sometimes Time crept slowly onwards
like an exhausted tortoise.</i>

591
01:30:31,710 --> 01:30:37,570
<i>Sometimes it tore through life
like a vulture in search of prey.</i>

592
01:30:38,270 --> 01:30:41,260
<i>Time took no choice of death or life,</i>

593
01:30:41,520 --> 01:30:43,460
<i>decay or growth,</i>

594
01:30:43,650 --> 01:30:44,630
<i>and love,</i>

595
01:30:44,710 --> 01:30:45,440
<i>hate</i>

596
01:30:45,540 --> 01:30:46,960
<i>or jealousy.</i>

597
01:30:47,490 --> 01:30:49,420
<i>It ignored all those things</i>

598
01:30:49,480 --> 01:30:53,310
<i>which are so important to us
that we forgot Time.</i>

599
01:33:48,510 --> 01:33:50,560
Don't you feel well?

600
01:33:52,110 --> 01:33:53,400
I'm going to die.

601
01:33:55,100 --> 01:33:55,970
Now?

602
01:33:58,440 --> 01:33:59,520
Today.

603
01:34:01,030 --> 01:34:04,020
I promised I'll tell you.

604
01:34:05,540 --> 01:34:06,670
How awful!

605
01:34:07,290 --> 01:34:08,110
Yes.

606
01:34:09,100 --> 01:34:10,380
It's not easy.

607
01:34:13,230 --> 01:34:14,680
Go and fetch the others.

608
01:34:16,430 --> 01:34:17,580
Please.

609
01:34:19,360 --> 01:34:22,050
I won't die before you come back.

610
01:34:30,240 --> 01:34:35,550
<i>Even before the sun had risen,
Antonia knew her days were numbered.</i>

611
01:34:35,950 --> 01:34:39,530
<i>She knew more than that,
she knew this would be her last day.</i>

612
01:34:56,800 --> 01:34:59,470
<i>She would call her loved ones
to her bedside,</i>

613
01:35:00,430 --> 01:35:04,400
<i>inform them of her imminent death,
close her eyes, and die.</i>

614
01:35:16,480 --> 01:35:19,430
<i>Farmer Bas would make
her coffin himself.</i>

615
01:35:19,550 --> 01:35:25,330
<i>Russian Olga would lay her out
with her customary discretion.</i>

616
01:35:25,660 --> 01:35:28,570
<i>There would be nothing
to be ashamed of.</i>

617
01:35:50,170 --> 01:35:52,040
That's Mad Madonna.

618
01:35:52,270 --> 01:35:54,580
She's calling me to play outside.

619
01:36:33,720 --> 01:36:36,210
<i>Her daughter Danielle
would bottle up her grief,</i>

620
01:36:36,580 --> 01:36:39,450
<i>which would later explode on canvas.</i>

621
01:36:56,580 --> 01:37:00,860
<i>Her granddaughter ThÃ©rÃ¨se would not
be able to prevent herself wondering</i>

622
01:37:00,940 --> 01:37:05,450
<i>what was the exact volume
of Antonia's last breath.</i>

623
01:37:12,800 --> 01:37:16,390
<i>And I, Sarah, her great-granddaughter,</i>

624
01:37:16,730 --> 01:37:20,520
<i>would not leave the death-bed
of my beloved great-grandmother,</i>

625
01:37:20,650 --> 01:37:24,890
<i>because I wanted to be with her
when the miracle of death</i>

626
01:37:25,030 --> 01:37:30,060
<i>parted Antonia's soul
from her formidable body.</i>

627
01:37:50,080 --> 01:37:56,720
And as this long chronicle reaches its
conclusion, nothing has come to an end.
